        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>We are a group of young individuals who want to be able to go outside with friends again. Our group was tasked with making a website and a text for our english class but this subject is much more important than just some grades. Personally if I was in the risk group I would not want to fear for my life just to get groceries especially if the groceries are for a person causing my dismay.
